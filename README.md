# odin-recipes
Hello! This project is related to The Odin Project's Recipe project found in the Foundations course.

In this Foundations project, I learned how to link between webpages to navigate my website. I also learned how to make proper unordered/ordered lists properly and easy to read.

I hope to come back to this project and add more recipes to my collection. I also want to add more CSS elements to this project later down the line.
